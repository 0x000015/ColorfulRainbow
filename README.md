This allows you to have access to the new DLC for Space Engineer's latest DLC. This includes the Decorations DLC,Decorations DLC 2, Frostbite, and Economy's DLC blocks. (ATM and Vending Machine)

This should also work in multiplayer aswell aslong as the SpaceEngineers folder is dragged and dropped directly into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common or where ever you have your Space Engineers installed at.


The mod folder can be dragged and dropped into your AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Mods to use it offline or upload it to the workshop.


Keen, stop adding useless updates and start patching things. Thanks.

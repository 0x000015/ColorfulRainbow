This allows you to have access to the new DLC from Space Engineers called "Decorative Pack"
The mod folder can be dragged and dropped into your AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Mods to use it offline or upload it to the workshop.
Or you can use the CubeBlocks.sbc inside the BaseGame folder by dragging CubeBlocks.sbc into SpaceEngineers\Content\Data (this is the main game folder)

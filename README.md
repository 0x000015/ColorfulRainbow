This allows you to have access to the new DLC for Space Engineer's latest DLC. This includes the Decorations DLC, Decorations DLC 2, Frostbite, Economy (ATM and Vending Machine), and ScrapRace blocks.

This should work in multiplayer aswell aslong as the "SpaceEngineers" Folder is dropped into the C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ (Or wherever your Space Engineers install is)


The mod folder can be dragged and dropped into your AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Mods to use it offline or upload it to the workshop.


Keen, stop adding useless updates and start patching things. Thanks.

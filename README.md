This allows you to have access to the new DLC for Space Engineer's latest DLC. This includes the Decorations DLC, and Economy's DLC blocks. (ATM and Vending Machine)

This should also work in multiplayer aswell aslong as the CubeBlocks.sbc inside the SpaceEngineers folder is dragged and dropped directly into steams common directory


The mod folder can be dragged and dropped into your AppData\Roaming\SpaceEngineers\Mods to use it offline or upload it to the workshop.


Keen, stop adding useless updates and start patching things. Thanks.
